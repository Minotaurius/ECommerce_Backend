## Installation

In order to get your own copy of the E-Commerce Back End application, you just need to navigate to the repo and copy the link to the repo. Once you have that on your clipboard navigate to VS Code and run 'git clone ____' and paste the link in after that. Once you have that done make sure you CD into the correct directory and run "npm init -y &&& install" to download any required packages. Then run "source __ (path to the schema.sql file)" and "USE db_name" in your SQL terminal. Then head back over to your regular terminal and type "npm run seed" followed by "npm start" to bring the server online. From there you will need either Insomnia (showcased in demo) or HTTP (what I used while creating routes to test in VS Code) to edit the database.

## Usage

This terminal application is for any business (small or large) that has a internet retail presence and wants a way to track their e-commerce database and compete with other online retailers. With some more work and additional routes it could also be set up to edit the stock of items or even the price of items!
